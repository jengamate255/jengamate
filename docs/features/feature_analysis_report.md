# Feature Analysis Report

This report summarizes the status of the features requested for analysis.

## Feature Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| View product images and details | Implemented | The `ProductDetailsScreen` displays product information, and the data models support images and videos. |
| Request a quotation | Implemented | The codebase includes screens for submitting RFQs and inquiries, as well as data models for RFQs, inquiries, and quotes. |
| View quotations and pro forma invoices | Not Implemented | There is no functionality to view quotations or pro forma invoices. |
| Track delivery and shipping status | Implemented | The `OrderDetailsScreen` displays the order status, and the `TrackingUpdateDialog` allows for updating the tracking status. The `Order` model also includes a `trackingStatus` field. |
| Confirm payment and upload proof of payment | Partially Implemented | The `PaymentDialog` allows users to confirm that they have completed a bank transfer and to provide a reference number. However, there is no functionality to upload a proof of payment. |
| Complete the transaction | Partially Implemented | The `Order` model has a `status` field that can be updated to "DELIVERED", and the `OrderCard` widget reflects this status. However, there is no explicit "Complete Transaction" button or screen that marks the transaction as complete. The status is updated through the `TrackingUpdateDialog`. |

## Recommendations

Based on this analysis, I recommend the following:

*   **Implement the "View quotations and pro forma invoices" feature.** This is a critical feature that is currently missing.
*   **Enhance the "Confirm payment and upload proof of payment" feature.** Add the ability for users to upload a proof of payment.
*   **Improve the "Complete the transaction" feature.** Add a "Complete Transaction" button or screen to provide a clear and explicit way to mark a transaction as complete.

I am ready to proceed with implementing these recommendations. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
