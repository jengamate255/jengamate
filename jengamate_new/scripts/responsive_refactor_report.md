## ðŸ”§ Refactor Pattern

### Standard Refactor Steps
1. Replace `Scaffold` with `ResponsiveScaffold`
2. Replace hardcoded padding with `AdaptivePadding`
3. Replace responsive calculations with `ResponsiveLayout` utilities
4. Update grid layouts with `ResponsiveLayout.getGridCrossAxisCount()`
5. Replace spacing with `JMSpacing` tokens
6. Update responsive text sizing with theme-based approaches

### Example Before/After
```dart
// Before
Scaffold(
  body: Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
    child: GridView.count(
      crossAxisCount: Responsive.isDesktop(context) ? 4 : 2,
      // ...
    ),
  ),
)

// After  
ResponsiveScaffold(
  body: AdaptivePadding(
    child: GridView.count(
      crossAxisCount: ResponsiveLayout.getGridCrossAxisCount(
        context, mobile: 2, tablet: 3, desktop: 4, largeDesktop: 5
      ),
      // ...
    ),
  ),
)
```
