// DEPRECATED: database_service_extensions.dart
//
// This file contained extension methods on DatabaseService that referenced
// older model names (e.g., SupportTicketModel vs SupportTicket) and private
// members like `_firestore`. This caused widespread analyzer errors and
// duplicated functionality with the current `lib/services/database_service.dart`.
//
// To stabilize the codebase and avoid conflicts, the previous implementation
// is intentionally disabled. Migrate any remaining call sites to the
// up-to-date APIs in `database_service.dart`.
//
// If you need additional helpers, recreate them against the current models and
// public DatabaseService APIs, avoiding access to private members.

// ignore_for_file: unused_import, unused_element, dead_code
