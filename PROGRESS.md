# Project Progress

This document summarizes the significant progress made on the Jengamate application.

## Phase 1: UI Redesign

1.  **Complete UI Redesign:** All major screens were redesigned to match the new, modern UI mockups, providing a consistent and professional user experience.

2.  **New Screens Implemented:**
    *   **Dashboard:** A dynamic dashboard with a balance card, quick actions, promotional cards, and detailed statistics for orders and commissions.
    *   **Profile:** A clean, organized profile screen with grouped menu items for easy navigation.
    *   **Orders:** A functional order list with a search bar and detailed order cards showing status, customer info, and payment details.
    *   **Products:** A product marketplace view with a grid layout, search, sorting, and detailed product cards.
    *   **Categories:** A simple and clear list of product categories.

3.  **Modular Widget Architecture:**
    *   Created numerous reusable widgets (e.g., `BalanceCard`, `ProfileMenuItem`, `OrderCard`, `ProductCard`) to ensure the codebase is clean, maintainable, and scalable.

4.  **Theme and Styling:**
    *   Updated the application's theme (`theme.dart`) with a new color palette, typography (using Google Fonts 'Poppins'), and consistent styling for cards, buttons, and input fields.

## Phase 2: User Authentication (Firebase)

Successfully integrated a complete and secure user authentication flow using Firebase.

1.  **Firebase Integration:**
    *   Configured the project to connect with Firebase for both web and mobile platforms.
    *   Added necessary dependencies: `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, and `provider` for state management.

2.  **Authentication Service:**
    *   Created a dedicated `AuthService` (`lib/services/auth_service.dart`) to handle all authentication logic, including sign-in, sign-out, and listening to authentication state changes. This centralizes logic and keeps the UI clean.

3.  **Dynamic Login Screen:**
    *   The `LoginScreen` was converted to a `StatefulWidget` to manage form state, user input, and loading indicators.
    *   Implemented form validation for email and password fields and provided clear error feedback via SnackBars.

4.  **Authentication Wrapper:**
    *   Implemented an `AuthWrapper` widget (`lib/auth/auth_wrapper.dart`) that acts as the app's entry point, automatically showing the correct screen based on the user's login status.

5.  **Bug Fixes & Cleanup:**
    *   Systematically resolved numerous build and runtime errors related to Firebase configuration and deprecated code.
    *   Cleaned the project of all analyzer warnings, ensuring a healthy and maintainable codebase.

## Phase 3: Firestore Database Integration

Successfully connected the application to a Cloud Firestore backend for dynamic user data management.

1.  **Firestore Dependency:**
    *   Added the `cloud_firestore` package to the project dependencies.

2.  **User Data Modeling:**
    *   Created a `UserModel` (`lib/models/user_model.dart`) to provide a structured, type-safe way to handle user data.

3.  **Database Service:**
    *   Implemented a `DatabaseService` (`lib/services/database_service.dart`) to centralize all Firestore operations, starting with methods to create, update, and fetch user documents.

4.  **Dynamic Dashboard:**
    *   The `DashboardScreen` now fetches the logged-in user's data from Firestore and displays their name in a personalized welcome message, confirming the end-to-end data flow.

## Phase 4: Core Feature Implementation

### 1. New Inquiry Submission

Successfully implemented the end-to-end flow for creating and submitting new inquiries.

*   **New Inquiry Form:** Created a comprehensive form (`NewInquiryScreen`) that allows users to input project details and add multiple products to an inquiry.
*   **Dynamic Product Forms:** Implemented a dynamic list of product forms (`ProductFormCard`) that can be added or removed by the user.
*   **Firestore Integration:** Connected the form to the `DatabaseService` to save new inquiries to the `inquiries` collection in Firestore.

### 2. Technical Drawing Uploads (Firebase Storage)

Integrated Firebase Storage to allow users to attach technical drawings to their inquiries.

*   **Firebase Storage Dependency:** Added the `firebase_storage` package to the project.
*   **File Picking:** Implemented file picking functionality using the `image_picker` package, allowing users to select images from their device.
*   **File Upload Service:** Extended the `DatabaseService` with a method to upload files to Firebase Storage and retrieve the download URL.
*   **End-to-End Flow:** The inquiry submission process now uploads any attached drawings to Firebase Storage and saves the public URL to the corresponding product in the inquiry document.

## Next Steps:

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Continue to implement logic to show/hide UI elements based on user roles (e.g., Engineer, Supplier, Admin).
*   **Dynamic Data for All Screens:** Replace all remaining mock data (e.g., orders, products, commissions) with real data from Firestore.
*   **Feature Implementation:** Add functionality to the other buttons and actions (e.g., 'Pay Now', 'Withdrawals') by connecting them to the database.
*   **Develop remaining features** as per the project roadmap.
